Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item.

Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention.

When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.\n\nThe tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.",
